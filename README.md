# Demo Web

The above project is just a basic website of mine with the purpose of learning

## Installation

First you have to clone my project to your computer
Please create a separate folder to clone!!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntac3nt/DemoWeb
```

## Usage

Please contact me to get the .env file

Move to the folder you just cloned to
Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the project

```bash
npm start
```

That's it, and you can customize some things if you don't feel like it's right.
